# Design Pattern Summary: Office + AI Orchestrator Pattern

## Pattern Name
**Office + AI Orchestrator Pattern**

## Context
This pattern is used when building productivity add-ins (e.g., for Outlook) that provide intelligent, context-aware features by:
- Reading the user’s current workspace context (e.g., email content)
- Sending that context to an AI agent
- Orchestrating backend services and enriching the result with external data

## Problem
Developers need to expose intelligent, dynamic responses within a constrained UI (like a sidebar in Outlook), without embedding complex logic or sensitive data access directly in the frontend. The solution must:
- Authenticate users securely
- Interpret unstructured input (email body)
- Invoke LLMs with contextual awareness
- Call downstream APIs for enrichment
- Return usable, context-tailored suggestions to the user

## Forces
- Add-ins operate in a sandbox and cannot perform direct API calls to internal systems
- LLMs require tailored prompts and context
- External data sources (e.g., case systems) must be queried securely and selectively

## Solution
Use a **Façade + Orchestrator** design with modular components:

### Components
| Component           | Role                                            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Outlook Add-in**  | Façade/UI layer that reads email content and initiates backend call |
| **Backend API**     | Orchestrator that authenticates the user, prepares structured context, and coordinates downstream calls |
| **AI Agent**        | Strategy handler for AI logic (prompt crafting, chain-of-thought reasoning, response generation) |
| **Azure AI Foundry**| Execution engine for semantic functions and orchestration via Semantic Kernel |
| **External API**    | Adapter/enrichment source (e.g., case management, CRM, support database) |

## Diagram
_See linked architecture diagram in the task pane project._

## Benefits
- Clean separation of concerns: UI, orchestration, AI, and external data
- Scalable: New use cases handled by swapping or adding agent logic
- Secure: All sensitive logic and auth reside in backend
- Maintainable: Central orchestration point supports observability, retries, error handling

## Trade-offs
- Slight increase in latency due to network hops
- Requires Azure AD app registration and auth setup
- Complex agent logic may require prompt engineering best practices

## Related Patterns
- **Backend for Frontend (BFF)**
- **Function Orchestration** (in AI agents)
- **Adapter Pattern** (for calling APIs)
- **Facade Pattern** (in the add-in layer)

## When to Use
- You need to provide intelligent suggestions in constrained UI environments like Outlook, Teams, or Office
- You want to use LLMs contextually but keep control of business logic and data access centrally
- You want AI results tailored using external systems (like case data, customer history, etc.)

## When Not to Use
- When full context must remain client-side (e.g., extremely sensitive on-device processing)
- If low latency and real-time interaction is critical and AI response time is a bottleneck

## Example Use Cases
- AI-powered customer support reply assistant in Outlook
- Sales coaching that reads email and suggests CRM actions
- Legal teams getting auto-drafted contracts or clause summaries from inbound messages
